This webpage is a collection of election analytics blogs made by student forecasters in the course Gov 1347 at Harvard University. The goal of these blogs is to provide **descriptive analyses and regularly updated predictions around the outcome of the 2020 presidential election**. Forecasters use rigorous quantitative and statistical methods and political reseach to make scientifically-informed commentary around different facets of the race (e.g., the economy, ad campaigns). Check back on *November 1* for the final predictions from each forecaster.
