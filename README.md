# Welcome! 

![](map2016.png)

This webpage is a collection of election analytics blogs made by student forecasters in the course Gov 1347 at Harvard University (taught by Ryan Enos with teaching fellows Soubhik Barari and Sun Young Park). 

The goal of these blogs is to provide **descriptive analyses and regularly updated predictions around the outcome of the 2020 presidential election**. Forecasters use rigorous quantitative and statistical methods and political reseach to make scientifically-informed commentary around different facets of the race (e.g., the economy, ad campaigns). 


## Summary of forecasts

Below is a series of graphical and tabular summaries of our class's forecasts for the 2020 election. We can see from **Figure 1** that, overall, Biden is heavily favored to win the race with only <u>one</u> out of our 27 forecasts predicting that Trump will cross `270 EV`.

As we approach Election Day, Biden [appears to be ahead in the polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/) by a `>5%` margin in some battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvannia and barely ahead in other battlegrounds like Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. **Figure 2** shows that the majority of our forecasters predict that Biden will win in the battleground states of <span style="color:blue">Florida, Arizona, Pennsylvannia, Michigan, New Hampshire</span> and <span style="color:blue">Wisconsin</span>, while Trump will claim <span style="color:red">Georgia, North Carolina</span> and <span style="color:red">Ohio</span>. And yes, <span style="color:red">Texas</span> as well.

How certain are we about these forecasts? For forecasters who predicted state-level popular voteshares [^1], we certainly see some variance in these predictions ranging from `5-10%`. There seems to be considerable disagreement about Trump winning <span style="color:red">North Carolina</span> and <span style="color:red">Georgia</span> (and a surprising amount for <span style="color:red">Texas</span>, with two forecasts predicting a historic flip). For Biden, there is similar, though slightly less, disagreement about <span style="color:blue">Florida</span> and <span style="color:blue">Arizona</span> though a solid consensus for <span style="color:blue">New Hampshire, Michigan,</span> and <span style="color:blue">Pennsylvannia</span>.

Nevertheless, averaged together, the resulting map of state-level popular voteshares shown below in **Figure 4** sees a considerable amount of (literal) grey area. There may be consensus on the eventual winner of some major swing states, but the <u>mean</u> of these point predictions reveals very slim win margins for Biden.

Taken together, Gov 1347 forecasts tell us that there will be a tight race ahead of us in the 24 hours -- or days -- to come.
