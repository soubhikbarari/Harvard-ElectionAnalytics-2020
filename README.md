# Welcome! 

![](map2016.png)

This webpage is a collection of election analytics blogs made by student forecasters in the course Gov 1347 at Harvard University (taught by Ryan Enos with teaching fellows Soubhik Barari and Sun Young Park). 

The goal of these blogs is to provide **descriptive analyses and regularly updated predictions around the outcome of the 2020 presidential election**. Forecasters use rigorous quantitative and statistical methods and political reseach to make scientifically-informed commentary around different facets of the race (e.g., the economy, ad campaigns). 

Check back on *November 1* for the final predictions from each forecaster.
